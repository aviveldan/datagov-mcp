# DataGov Israel MCP Server

Easily interact with the Israeli Government Public API (data.gov.il) using this project.

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements

#### uv
This project uses the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager, a drop-in replacement to pip.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd datagov-mcp
   ```
2. Install dependencies (for windows users - [refrain from running this script in folders watched by onedrive](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7906)):
   ```bash
   uv venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # source .venv/bin/activate for MacOS / Linux
   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
   uv lock # update the project's lockfile
   ```
   

### Usage
You can install this server in [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) and interact with it right away by running:
```bash
fastmcp install claude desktop server.py
```

Alternatively, you can test it with the MCP Inspector:
```bash
fastmcp dev server.py
```

If client / server ports are busy, you can easily free them using [nano-dev-utils](https://pypi.org/project/nano-dev-utils/):
```bash
uv pip install nano-dev-utils
```
in terminal type 'python', and then run the following code:

```python
from nano_dev_utils import release_ports 
pr = release_ports.PortsRelease()
pr.release_all()
```
type exit() to get back to terminal. Alternatively run the above code as a script.
